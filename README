jffind is a tool for finding files whose names contain 
certain keywords.

Usage: jffind <directory> <keyword> ...

It prints out the full path of files in <directory> and 
its subdirectories that contain <keyword>s in the file name. 

Only files with extension in the EXT_WHITELIST set hardcoded
in the program are printed. Currently the extensions
accepted are PDF, DJVU and DJV.

The entire directory tree is scanned each time the program is run.

jffind is written in Python and uses the PyICU library.
